# DiscordCoin

DiscordCoin is a Discord based cryptocurrency that is easy to setup.

## Setup

Setup is really easy:

1. Setup a local MongoDB instance.
2. Install discord.py and pymongo.
3. Edit the config.json file. (In the game, `[p]` means the prefix)
4. Start the bot and hope it all works.

Feel free to ask for help if you get stuck.
